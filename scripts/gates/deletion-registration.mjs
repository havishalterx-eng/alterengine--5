/**
 * Gate: everything holding tenant data registers with Deletion & Retention.
 *
 * Rule 20. Erasure that misses one table is not erasure, and the miss stays
 * invisible until someone exercises a legal right and the answer is wrong.
 *
 * Rebuilt after the Adversary evaded the first version, which keyed on class
 * names ending Store, Repository, Repo, Dao or Table. This passed cleanly:
 *
 *   export const workflowCatalog = {
 *     async save(tenantId: TenantId, workflow: Workflow): Promise<void> {
 *       await db.query(
 *         'insert into workflows (tenant_id, body) values ($1, $2)',
 *         [tenantId, workflow],
 *       );
 *     },
 *   };
 *
 * It holds tenant rows under none of those names. The persistence call is the
 * signal, not the identifier.
 *
 * The second bug is also fixed: registration anywhere in a file no longer
 * satisfies every table in it. Each written table is checked by name.
 *
 * Reconciled after Builder A was correctly blocked. This gate originally
 * demanded a `registerForDeletion()` call, which contradicted the decision
 * recorded in PHASE-1-SCOPE: the declaration lives in code as reviewable data,
 * because a database row does not appear in a pull request diff. Builder B
 * built the declarative form; the gate was the thing that was wrong, and
 * Builder A refused to add a fake call to satisfy it, which is exactly right.
 *
 * STAGED. This is the source-level layer. The Integrator owns the
 * schema-derived gate for component 44, which reads live tables from
 * information_schema and is the load-bearing one. Contract 44 forbids a
 * heuristic as the sole check, and this is explicitly not the sole check —
 * it is the early-warning layer that works before any migration exists.
