/**
 * Gate: safety is what you get by doing nothing.
 *
 * Closes systemic pattern 2. In the previous build a missing environment
 * variable selected a mock; a half-configured deployment crashed loudly at
 * boot while a fully unconfigured one started happily and discarded every
 * email.
 *
 * Rebuilt after the Adversary evaded the first version. That version matched
 * `process.env[...]` on a single physical line, so all of these passed:
 *
 *   process.env.ALTER_RUNTIME_MODE ?? 'development'     // dot form
 *   process.env['X'] ??\n  'development'                // multi-line
 *   const { ALTER_AUTH_MODE: m = 'allow' } = process.env // destructured
 *   { ALTER_RUNTIME_MODE: 'development', ...process.env } // merge
 *   process.env['X'] ? process.env['X'] : 'mock'         // ternary
 *
 * Two checks now. The second is the structural one and matters more.
